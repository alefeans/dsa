In this repo, i'll put some code challenges that i solved (and still solving), in many platforms ([hackerhank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [practice python](https://www.practicepython.org/), [project euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and some programming books exercises). The goal is to improve my development skills and show what i'm learning in my **pythonic** journey to the *Dev side*.

## Running the Code

Until this commit, the code were all made using only the standard library, so the requirements are here just for the *tests*:

```
git clone https://github.com/alefeans/learning_python.git .
python {platform}/{challenge}/{challenge}.py
```

## Tests

To run the unit tests, you'll need to:
```
pip install pytest
```
or:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then:
```
pytest
```
